# studio_comm
This is a simple Node.js application that demonstrates how to handle file uploads using the Multer middleware in conjunction with the Express web framework.

# Prerequisites
Before running this application, you must have the following software installed on your system:

# Node.js (version 10 or later)
Installation
To install the dependencies for this application, run the following command in the project directory:

npm install
# Usage
To start the application, run the following command:
npm start
This will start the server and listen on port 8000.

Once the server is running, you can submit a form with file uploads by sending a POST request to the /submit-form endpoint. You can use a tool like Postman to send the request.

The form data should include two fields, profile_picture and package, each containing a file to upload. The uploaded files will be stored in the uploads directory in the project directory, with a unique filename generated by Multer.
