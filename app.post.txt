It defines a route for handling a POST request to "/submit-form".
It uses the Multer middleware to handle the file upload. Specifically, it expects three files with names "packageName", "date", and "repeat".
It then extracts the value of the "xamlFile" field from the request body.
It writes the "xamlFile" value to a new file on the server using Node's built-in file system module.
It uploads the newly created file to Google Cloud Storage using the @google-cloud/storage package.
If the file is uploaded successfully, it retrieves the public URL of the file using the "makePublic" method of the file object.
It saves the form data to a Postgres database using the "pg" package. Specifically, it inserts a new row into the "processes" table with the values of "packageName", "date", "xamlFile", and "repeat".
Finally, it sends a response to the client with a JSON object containing a message indicating that the form data was saved successfully.
